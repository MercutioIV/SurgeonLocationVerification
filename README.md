# SurgeonLocationVerification
# Written by Dylan Werelius on August 3rd 2022

The SurgeonLocationVerification program is designed to look at a premade excel spreadsheet, look up all the surgeons on the list and compare their location as defined by the excel spreadsheet and compare it to their actual location as determined by the NPPES NPI Registry. If the locations do not match, then the cells holding the city and state are colored red and the correct city and state are written into the Q and R column. The program will print to the console the amount of surgeons who are no longer registered, the amount of surgeons whose location is inaccurate, and the amount of time that the program took to complete.
